    <h3>Service Details</h3>
    <p>
      This is the service details page.  Use this page to modify the meta-data, plans, and
      policies for the service.  There is no need to follow the tabs in order, but note that
      you will need to fill out a minimum amount of data before the service can be published
      to the Gateway.  In particular, the Implementation, Definition and Plans tabs are important (more
      information below).

    <h4>Applications contracted to use this service</h4>
    <p ng-if="!(isPublished || isRetired)">This service is not yet published, and therefore cannot have any contracts yet.</p>

    <h4>Implementation</h4>
    <p>
      The 'Implementation' tab is where you go to configure the details of the real service
      being managed.  This is where you tell us where the service is, so that we can
      actually invoke it at runtime.
    </p><br>

    <h4>Definition</h4>
    <p>
      The 'Definition' tab allows you to configure a Service Definition document
      for your service.  A Service Definition is a detailed description of the capabilities
      of your Service (operation names, http verbs, data models).  For example, you might
      add a Swagger spec document as your Service Definition.
    </p><br>

    <h4>Plans</h4>
    <p>
      The 'Plans' tab is used to configure which Plans (already defined in the Organization)
      are available when an Application wishes to create a Service Contract with this
      Service.  Optionally, a Service can also be marked as "Public", which means that no
      Service Contract is required (the Service can be invoked without sending an API Key).
    </p><br>

    <h4>Policies</h4>
    <p>
      The 'Policies' tab is where you go if you wish to configure any policies that should
      be enforced for *all* requests to the Service, regardless of which user, application,
      or plan is being used.  In other words, Service-level policies.
    </p><br>

    <h4>Contracts</h4>
    <p>
      The 'Contracts' tab will show a table of all Applications that have created Service
      Contracts to this Service.  In other words, it shows all of the registered
      consumers of the Service.  Note that if the Service is marked as "Public", this tab
      will likely be empty.
    </p><br>

    <h4>Endpoint</h4>
    <p>
      The 'Endpoint' tab will show you information about how to invoke the Service once
      it is published to the API Gateway.
    </p><br>

    <h4>Activity</h4>
    <p>
      The 'Activity' tab shows a history of all the changes made to the Service.  Essentially
      it is an audit log.
